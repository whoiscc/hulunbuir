//! Hulunbuir is a cross-thread garbage collector. The managed objects could be used in
//! multithreads, and collecting process may happen in any of them.
//!
//! Normally, reading or updating a managed object must lock global collector as well,
//! which significantly decrease multithread performance. However, Hulunbuir does not provide
//! common "read guard" and "write guard" interface; instead it only supports two functions:
//! `allocate` and `replace`. The first one create a managed object, and may trigger a garbage
//! collecting process if necessary; the second one replace the value of a managed object with
//! a new one provided by argument. The global collector only have to be locked during replacing
//! and the lock could be released when working thread owns the value. So the lock will not
//! become the bottleneck of performance.
//!
//! Hulunbuir also provides `Slot` as higher level abstraction and interface.
//!
//! # Basic usage
//!
//! ```
//! use hulunbuir::{Address, Collector, Keep};
//!
//! // create a managed type
//! struct ListNode(i32, Option<Address>);
//!
//! // implement Keep for it, so it could be managed
//! impl Keep for ListNode {
//!     fn with_keep<F: FnMut(&Address)>(&self, mut keep: F) {
//!         // each node keeps only its tail, so call `keep` with it...
//!         if let Some(tail) = &self.1 {
//!             // ...if the node has tail
//!             keep(tail)
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // create a collector with 128 slots available
//!     let mut collector = Collector::new(128);
//!     let root = collector.allocate(ListNode(0, None)).unwrap();
//!     collector.set_root(root.clone());
//!     let tail = collector.allocate(ListNode(1, None)).unwrap();
//!     // replace root node out with something not important
//!     let mut root_node = collector.replace(&root, ListNode(42, None)).unwrap();
//!     root_node.1 = Some(tail);
//!     // replace root node back
//!     let _ = collector.replace(&root, root_node).unwrap();
//!     
//!     let _orphan = collector.allocate(ListNode(2, None)).unwrap();
//!     // before collecting...
//!     assert_eq!(collector.alive_count(), 3);
//!     collector.collect();
//!     // after collecting...
//!     assert_eq!(collector.alive_count(), 2);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This `replace`-based object updating strategy is suitable for simple single-thread usage.
//! The collector will work correctly **only when no garbage collection happens when any
//! "real" object is replaced out**, which means, when any of them *is* replaced out:
//! * no explicit calling to `Collector::collect`
//! * no calling to `Collector::allocate`, since it may trigger collection as well if there's
//! no slot available
//!
//! In multithreading context, none of above could be archieved since each thread has no idea
//! about what the others are doing. So more complicated strategy must be introduced. Hulunbuir
//! provides `slot` module for this purpose, but you are free to develop your own one.
