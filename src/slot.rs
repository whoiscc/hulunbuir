//! First of all, the "slot" below is not the same as the slot I mentioned in main module.
//! Theoretically, instances of any type which implements `Keep` trait could be inserted
//! into the slots of a collector, and the `Slot<T>` type provided by this module is only one
//! of them. However, there's real benefit to use it instead of some random types.
//! 
//! # Multithreading in action
//! 
//! Suppose you are migrating the list type from main module's example into multithreading
//! environment. You need to handle at least two problems properly to prevent everything
//! from crashing:
//! * What if one thread triggers garbage collection when some of the objects are replaced
//! with some fake ones by other threads?
//! * What if one thread tries to replace out a managed object, which is currently replaced
//! out by another thread?
//! 
//! Fortunately, you can solve both the problems by replacing `Collector<T>` with 
//! `Collector<Slot<T>>`, and use `take` and `fill` methods instead of `replace`.
//! 
//! # First sight in `Slot`
//! 
//! We could rewrite the example in main module with `Slot` like this:
//! 
//! ```rust
//! use hulunbuir::{Address, Collector, Keep};
//! use hulunbuir::slot::{Slot, Take};
//! 
//! // exactly same type as before
//! struct ListNode(i32, Option<Address>);
//! 
//! impl Keep for ListNode {
//!     fn with_keep<F: FnOnce(&[Address])>(&self, keep: F) {
//!         if let Some(tail) = self.1.to_owned() {
//!             keep(&[tail])
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut collector = Collector::new(128);
//!     // allocate a Slot<ListNode> instead of ListNode
//!     let root = collector.allocate(Slot::new(ListNode(0, None))).unwrap();
//!     collector.set_root(root.clone());
//!     let tail = collector.allocate(Slot::new(ListNode(1, None))).unwrap();
//!     // take root object out of slot, and leave a "hole" there
//!     let mut root_node = match collector.take(&root).unwrap() {
//!         Take::Free(object) => object,
//!         Take::Busy(_) => unreachable!(),  // we know that no one is using it
//!     };
//!     root_node.1 = Some(tail);
//!     // fill the hole with updated object
//!     collector.fill(&root, root_node).unwrap();
//! 
//!     // the rest part is the same as before
//!     let _orphan = collector.allocate(Slot::new(ListNode(2, None))).unwrap();
//!     assert_eq!(collector.alive_count(), 3);
//!     collector.collect();
//!     assert_eq!(collector.alive_count(), 2);
//! }
//!``` 
//! 
//! By taking object out of slot, `Slot` automatically:
//! * Provides a "hole" object to prevent the following threads taking it, or, to make them
//! realizing that some other one is taking it
//! * Calls `Keep::with_keep` method of the object before giving it out, and caches the
//! result in the hole. So the hole could "pretend" to be the taken object if garbage 
//! collection happens.
//! 
//! Please pay extra attention to the second function. It means **collector will not be aware of
//! any change to the kept list of taken object until it is filled back**. So, if you are doing
//! something like this:
//! 1. lock the collector, allocate a new object, unlock it
//! 2. (lock) take an object out (unlock) and make it keeping the new object
//! 3. lock the collector, fill the object, unlock it
//! 
//! Then you will get chance to lose your new object unexpectedly, if some other thread
//! triggers a garbage collection while your thread is in the second stage. The correct
//! way is to hold the lock through all three stages.
//! 
//! # Blocking on taking
//! 
//! In most of the time, when we trying to take an object out but someone else is using it,
//! all we want to do is just waiting. However, the `take` method returns immediately, to
//! prevent current thread holding the global collector too long. In addition to trying again
//! and again as a spin lock, you can leverage on the other variant of `Take`:
//! 
//! ```rust
//! # use std::sync::Mutex;
//! # use hulunbuir::{Address, Collector, Keep};
//! # use hulunbuir::slot::{Slot, Take};
//! 
//! fn wait<T: Keep>(collector: &Mutex<Collector<Slot<T>>>, address: &Address) -> T {
//!     loop {
//!         let take = collector.lock().unwrap().take(address).unwrap();
//!         match take {
//!             Take::Free(value) => return value,
//!             Take::Busy(parker) => parker.park(),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//! 
//! The `parker` is a [`crossbeam::sync::Parker`][1]. By calling its `park` method, current
//! thread will be blocked until the paired `Unparker::unpark` is called, which will be done
//! by `Slot::fill`. Notice that it's not trivial to extract `take` variable out of `match`
//! block, so that the mutex could be released before current thread is parked which will 
//! become a dead lock.
//!
//! [1]: https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.2/crossbeam/sync/struct.Parker.html
//! 
//! The `wait` function above may be idiomatic, but I cannot find a way to provide it because
//! I have no idea what kind of mutex you prefer.
//! 
//! # Disadvantage on using `Slot`
//! 
//! The first disadvantage is that you cannot concurrent read an object in an obvious way. 
//! Certainly you can absolutely perform concurrent reading with something like
//!
//! > `Arc<Mutex<Collector<Slot<Arc<RwLock<T>>>>>>`
//! 
//! As we all know it turns out that Rust is all about adding another layer.
//! 
//! The second disadvantage, which is absolutely not limited to `Slot`, is that objects must
//! be moved back and forth again and again which may hurt performance seriously. This can also
//! be prevented by adding a `Box` layer (what I just say?). At the very end Hulunbuir does not
//! concern much about memory location right now. Maybe some day I will write a new add-on
//! like `Slot` for it!
//!
